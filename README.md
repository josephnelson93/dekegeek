This repository contains hockey analysis completed by the DekeGeek team over the years.

Here's a few projects we've worked on:

## Gretzky v Ovechkin

Is Ovechkin on pace to break Ovechkin's goals record? [Matt Speck](https://github.com/mjspeck) and [Joseph Nelson](https://twitter.com/josephofiowa) are working on creating some visualizations to find out.

## BOSHAC 2016

In 2016, Brian Carothers ([bcarothers19](https://github.com/bcarothers19)) and [Joseph Nelson](https://twitter.com/josephofiowa) presented on what we branded the "Defenseman's Paradox" at the [Babson Hockey Analytics Conference](http://statsportsconsulting.com/boshac2016/), the first hockey-only sports analytics conference hosted in Boston.
